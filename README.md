## Task 3: Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## About project
This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes like airplane, car, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.

The model is enhanced with:

Data Augmentation to improve generalization

Batch Normalization & Dropout for stability and regularization

Learning Rate Scheduling for better convergence

## Dataset

CIFAR-10, automatically downloaded via torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10

Contains:

50,000 training images

10,000 test images

10 classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck
